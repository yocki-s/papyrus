Veritrans API Docs
==================

Create beautiful API documentation. Think of it as an intelligent, responsive and clean documentation Veritrans API.


Getting Started with Papyrus
------------------------------

### Prerequisites

You're going to need:

 - **Linux or OS X** — Windows may work, but is unsupported.
 - **Ruby, version 1.9.3 or newer**
 - **Bundler** — If Ruby is already installed, but the `bundle` command doesn't work, just run `gem install bundler` in a terminal.

### Getting Set Up

 1. Fork this repository on Github.
 2. Clone *your forked repository* (not our original one) to your hard drive with `git clone https://github.com/YOURUSERNAME/papyrus.git`
 3. `cd papyrus`
 4. Install all dependencies: `bundle install`
 5. Start the test server: `bundle exec middleman server`

Or use the included Dockerfile! (must install Docker first)

You can now see the docs at <http://localhost:4567>. Whoa! That was fast!
